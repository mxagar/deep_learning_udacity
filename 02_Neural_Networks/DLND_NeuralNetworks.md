# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree: Introduction

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

The nanodegree is composed of six modules:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Networks
3. Convolutonal Neural Networks (CNN)
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
6. Deploying a Model

Each module has a folder with its respective notes. This folder is the one of the **second module**: Neural Networks.

Additionally, note that:
- I made many hand-written nortes, which I will scan and push to this repostory.
- I forked the Udacity repository for the exercisesl [deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch); all the material and  notebooks are there.

## Overview of Contents

2. Introduction to Deep Learning

# 2. Neural Networks

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Neural Networks

The content is mostly recorded in the hand-written notes.
There is overlap with the CVND = Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree (overlap in videos, notebooks, etc.):
