# Extra: New Deep Learning Architectures and Applications

The root repository contains my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

The nanodegree is composed of six modules:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Networks and Pytorch Guide
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
6. Deploying a Model

However, **the present module/folder contains my personal notes on *new* architectures and applications that appeared post 2018**. Currently (2022-11), the field seems to be advancing extremely fast, so I decided to create an extra subfolder with my notes on this journey.
