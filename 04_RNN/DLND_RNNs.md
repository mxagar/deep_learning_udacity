# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

The nanodegree is composed of six modules:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Networks and Pytorch Guide
3. Convolutonal Neural Networks (CNN)
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
6. Deploying a Model

Each module has a folder with its respective notes. This folder is the one of the **fourth module**: Recurrent Neural Networks.

Additionally, note that:

- I made many hand-written nortes, which I will scan and push to this repostory.
- I forked the Udacity repository for the exercisesl [deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch); all the material and  notebooks are there.
- This module in particular is mostly covered in the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891). I have a repository with notes on it: [computer_vision_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/computer_vision_udacity), module `03_Advanced_CV_and_DL`.
