# Tensorflow/Keras Guide

I completed this guide after following these two courses:

- [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) offered by IBM & Coursera.
- [Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/) offered by Jos√© Marcial Portilla on Udemy.

However, I decided to locate this guide in the repository where I have my notes on the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) to keep all Deep Learning material centralized in one location.

My repositories related to source courses are:

- [machine_learning_ibm/05_Deep_Learning](https://github.com/mxagar/machine_learning_ibm/tree/main/05_Deep_Learning)
- [data_science_python_tools/19_NeuralNetworks_Keras](https://github.com/mxagar/data_science_python_tools/tree/main/19_NeuralNetworks_Keras).
