# Keras/Tensorflow Guide

I didn't complete this guide after the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), but, instead, after following these two courses:

- [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) offered by IBM & Coursera.
- [Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/) offered by Jos√© Marcial Portilla on Udemy.

However, I decided to keep the guide and examples in the current repository, to have all Deep Learning guides and templates centralized in one place.

My repositories related to source courses are:

- [machine_learning_ibm/05_Deep_Learning](https://github.com/mxagar/machine_learning_ibm/tree/main/05_Deep_Learning)
- [data_science_python_tools/19_NeuralNetworks_Keras](https://github.com/mxagar/data_science_python_tools/tree/main/19_NeuralNetworks_Keras).
