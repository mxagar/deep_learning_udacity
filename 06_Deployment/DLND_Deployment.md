# Geneartive Adversarial Networks (GAN)

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

The nanodegree is composed of six modules:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Networks and Pytorch Guide
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
6. Deploying a Model

Each module has a folder with its respective notes. This folder is the one of the **fifth module**: Generative Adversarial Networks.

Additionally, note that:

- I made many hand-written notes; check the PDFs.
- I made many hand-written notes; check the PDFs.
- I forked the Udacity repositories for the exercises; most the material and notebooks are there:
  - [deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)
  - [DL_PyTorch](https://github.com/mxagar/DL_PyTorch)
  - [sagemaker-deployment](https://github.com/mxagar/sagemer-deployment)
