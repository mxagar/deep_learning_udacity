# Pytorch Guide

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

The nanodegree is composed of six modules:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Networks and Pytorch Guide
3. Convolutonal Neural Networks (CNN)
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
6. Deploying a Model

Each module has a folder with its respective notes. This folder is the one of the **second module** and it contains a Pytorch guide.

Additionally, note that I made many hand-written nortes, which I will scan and push to this repostory.

Here, I refence notebooks that are present in two repositories (both updated):

- [DL_PyTorch](https://github.com/mxagar/DL_PyTorch), referenced in the CVND
- [deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), the one used in the DLND

Additionally, in this particular folder, I also collect some examples and summaries made by myself.
